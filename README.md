# TADS/WoW/Clockfield Simulation Explorations

EDIT: 

Added qft_tads_pyvista_3d4.py which is 3d version that does everything live with sliders. It uses pyvistaqt also which you have to install 
wiht pip install pyvistaqt.

This repository contains Python scripts exploring emergent phenomena based on theoretical ideas combining concepts like TADS (Temporal Accumulation Dilation Space), WoW (World-on-World / Wave-on-Wave), and a Clockfield.

These simulations model fields with non-linear dynamics, aiming to generate complex structures, particle-like excitations, and potentially signatures like 1/f noise from simple underlying rules.

## Files

* `phiworld2.py`:
    A 2D simulation of the TADS/WoW Clockfield (`Ψ₀`). Features a Tkinter GUI for interactive parameter adjustment and visualization using Matplotlib. It simulates a scalar field (`phi`) based on a non-linear PDE incorporating field-dependent wave speed, a double-well potential, and a biharmonic term (implicit WoW influence). Detects emergent pseudo-particles (local maxima) and saves their history (`time`, `step`, `particle_count`, `particle_details`) to `particle_log.csv` when the GUI window is closed.

* `qft_as_tads_3d.py`:
    A 3D simulation based on similar physics principles as `phiworld.py`. It runs non-interactively from the command line, evolving the 3D `phi` field. Periodically saves the full 3D field state as NumPy arrays (`.npy` files) into the `./phi_data_3d/` directory.

* `night.py`:
    A 3D visualization tool using the PyVista library. Loads the latest `.npy` data file generated by `qft_as_tads_3d.py` and creates an interactive 3D plot. It's configured by default to show isosurfaces (surfaces of constant `phi` value) but can be modified to show volume rendering or slices. Requires PyVista to be installed locally.

* `cabbage.py`:
    A script that loads the `particle_log.csv` generated by the 2D `phiworld2.py` simulation. It then creates a static 3D scatter plot using Matplotlib, visualizing the spatio-temporal history of the emergent particles by plotting their X and Y coordinates against Time on the Z-axis.

## Dependencies

These scripts rely on:

* Python 3
* NumPy
* SciPy (specifically `scipy.ndimage.convolve` and `scipy.signal.convolve2d`)
* Matplotlib
* Tkinter (for `phiworld.py` GUI - usually included with Python)
* Pandas (for `cabbage.py` to read CSV)
* PyVista (for `night.py` 3D visualization - requires separate installation: `pip install pyvista`)

## Usage

1.  **2D Simulation & Particle Log Generation:**
    Run `python phiworld.py` to launch the interactive 2D simulation. Adjust parameters, observe emergent patterns. Close the GUI window normally to save the particle history to `particle_log.csv`.

2.  **Visualize 2D Particle Spacetime History:**
    After generating `particle_log.csv`, run `python cabbage.py` to see the 3D plot of particle positions over time.

3.  **3D Simulation Data Generation:**
    Run `python qft_as_tads_3d.py`. This will perform the 3D simulation and save state snapshots as `.npy` files in the `phi_data_3d` folder. Adjust `GRID_SIZE` and `TOTAL_STEPS` in the script as needed (note performance impact).

4.  **Interactive 3D Visualization:**
    Ensure you have PyVista installed (`pip install pyvista`). After generating data with `qft_as_tads_3d.py`, run `python night.py`. This will load the latest `.npy` file and display it using PyVista. Modify `VISUALIZATION_TYPE`, `POS_ISO_VALUE`, `NEG_ISO_VALUE` etc. within `night.py` to explore different views.
